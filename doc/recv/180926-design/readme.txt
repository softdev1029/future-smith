Hi Dejan,

We use Sketch software for making the UI design, and therefore do not have a PSD file to share.
However, I have uploaded the designs onto Invision platform from which you should be able to get the specifications. I have sent you an invitation on your email ID to join.

Are you familiar with Sketch or Invision? If not, I am happy to guide you through it.
Invision has an 'Inspector Mode' from which you can get design specifications.
Attached is a screenshot of what it looks like.
Here is a video tour: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPwq3iYMzm4

Let me know if you need any other details.

Regards,
